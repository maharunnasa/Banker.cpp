## Overview

The Banker's Algorithm is used in operating systems to allocate resources to processes in a way that avoids deadlock. This implementation checks if the system is in a safe state by simulating resource allocation for multiple processes.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bankers-algorithm.git
   cd bankers-algorithm

##Compile the program:

g++ -o bankers_algorithm bankers_algorithm.cpp

*Code Explanation*
The code is structured as follows:

Constants:

P: Number of processes.
R: Number of resources.
Functions:

calculateNeed: Calculates the need matrix which represents the remaining resource needs of each process.
isSafe: Determines if the system is in a safe state by checking if all processes can be executed to completion without causing a deadlock.
Main Function:

Initializes the available resources, maximum resources, and allocated resources matrices.
Calls isSafe to check if the system is in a safe state.
